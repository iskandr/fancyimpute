# fancyimpute

Simple implementation of [Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization](http://statweb.stanford.edu/%7Ecandes/papers/MatrixCompletion.pdf) by Emmanuel Candes and Benjamin Recht using cvxpy.

## Usage

```python

from fancyimpute import ConvexSolver

solver = ConvexSolver(
    min_value=0.0,
    max_value=1.0,
    error_tolerance=0.0005)

# X_incomplete has missing data which is represented with NaN values
X_filled = solver.complete(X_incomplete)
```
